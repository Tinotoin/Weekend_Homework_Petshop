Hi guys, I thought I'd add a copy of my statements to GitHub regarding this weekends homework - and the issues I've had.

I'm struggling with transferring my understanding of the concepts into the actual code itself. 

I can identify and understand the different information types, and read, understand and follow the code when it's already written - but I find it difficult to translate the test requirements into the code I need to write. 

So for the first half of the homework, rather than getting disheartened and frustrated, I've written my understanding of what the code should do - instead of the code itself.

Thanks, 

Tino
